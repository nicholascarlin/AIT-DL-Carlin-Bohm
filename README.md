Title: Deep Learning Fruit and Vegetable Classification Image Processor

Description: We want to make software that is capable of recognizing various fruits and vegetables, classifying them as such, and displaying their respective names.

The current python code stores photos from both datasets in a dictionary with the key being the fruit or vegetable name and the value being a list of the photos.
